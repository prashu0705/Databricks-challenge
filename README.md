## Day 2 – Apache Spark Fundamentals 🚀

Today I explored the fundamentals of Apache Spark using Databricks Community Edition.

### What I learned:
- Spark architecture (Driver, Executors, DAG)
- Difference between DataFrames and RDDs
- Lazy evaluation in Spark
- Using Databricks magic commands (%python, %sql, %fs)

### What I built:
- Loaded an e-commerce CSV dataset into Spark
- Performed select, filter, groupBy, and orderBy operations
- Aggregated revenue by product category
- Exported processed data back to storage

Apache Spark makes large-scale data processing both powerful and intuitive when using DataFrames.
