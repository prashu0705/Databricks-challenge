## Day 3 – Advanced Spark Analytics 🚀  
📅 11/01/26

Today I moved beyond basic Spark operations and worked on **advanced analytics patterns used in real-world data engineering and analytics workflows**.

### 🔍 What I learned:
- Performing **complex joins** between raw event data and aggregated metrics
- Using **window functions** to calculate running totals
- Creating **derived features** for analytics and ML use cases
- Understanding how Spark optimizes these operations using DAGs and lazy evaluation

---

### 🛠️ What I implemented:

#### 1️⃣ Complex Joins
- Joined raw user activity data with user-level purchase aggregates  
- Used LEFT JOINs to preserve non-purchasing users  
- Typical use case: customer analytics and behavioral segmentation

#### 2️⃣ Window Functions
- Calculated **running (cumulative) spend per user over time**
- Used `partitionBy` and `orderBy` to track user-level temporal behavior  
- Common in churn analysis, fraud detection, and growth analytics

#### 3️⃣ Derived Features
Engineered meaningful features such as:
- Total spend per user  
- Average spend per purchase  
- High-value user flag  
- Price bucket classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

These features are directly usable for:
- Dashboards
- Business insights
- Downstream ML models

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways:
- Spark window functions enable powerful time-based analytics at scale
- Feature engineering is a critical step between raw data and ML
- DataFrames provide both performance and readability for complex logic
- Spark transformations remain lazy until an action is triggered

## Day 4 – Delta Lake & Data Reliability (Unity Catalog) 🚀  
📅 12/01/26

Today I worked on **Delta Lake fundamentals with Unity Catalog**, focusing on how Databricks ensures data reliability, schema enforcement, and safe data ingestion in production environments.

This day was especially insightful because it exposed **real-world constraints and errors** that data engineers face while working with Delta + UC.

---

### 🔍 What I learned:

#### 1️⃣ CSV → Delta Conversion
- Converted raw e-commerce CSV data into **Delta format**
- Understood why Delta is preferred over CSV/Parquet for analytics pipelines

#### 2️⃣ Delta Tables with Unity Catalog
- Created **managed Delta tables** in Unity Catalog

Day 5 – Delta Lake Advanced Operations (Databricks)
Today’s focus was on managing incremental data, performance optimization, and storage hygiene using Delta Lake. These are critical concepts for building production-grade Lakehouse pipelines.
✅ What I Learned & Implemented
1️⃣ Incremental Data Handling with MERGE
Implemented upserts using Delta Lake MERGE
Efficiently handled new and updated records
Prevented duplicate data during incremental loads
Key use case: CDC pipelines and Bronze → Silver transformations
2️⃣ Querying Historical Data (Time Travel)
Queried previous versions of Delta tables
Used version-based and timestamp-based queries
Understood how Delta maintains transactional history
Useful for auditing, debugging, and rollback scenarios
3️⃣ Performance Optimization with OPTIMIZE
Compacted small files into larger ones
Used Z-Ordering on frequently filtered columns
Improved query latency and scan efficiency
Crucial for large analytical tables
4️⃣ Storage Cleanup with VACUUM
Removed obsolete files created by updates and merges
Learned retention-period best practices
Understood trade-offs between cleanup and time travel
🧠 Key Takeaway
Delta Lake is not just about storing data — it enables reliable incremental processing, auditability, high performance, and efficient storage management, all within the Lakehouse architecture.

📅 Day 6 – Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
📘 What I Learned
Today’s focus was on understanding and implementing the Medallion Architecture, a core design pattern in modern data lakehouse systems.
Bronze Layer (Raw)
Stores raw, immutable data exactly as received from source systems.
Silver Layer (Cleaned)
Applies data cleaning, validation, deduplication, and schema enforcement.
Gold Layer (Aggregated)
Contains business-ready datasets optimized for analytics and reporting.
This layered approach improves data quality, scalability, auditability, and performance, while enabling incremental and reliable data pipelines.
🛠️ Hands-on Tasks Completed
Designed a 3-layer Lakehouse architecture
Clearly defined responsibilities for Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
Followed separation-of-concerns best practices
Built Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion
Ingested raw data as-is
Preserved original schema and timestamps
Ensured append-only, immutable storage
Built Silver Layer – Cleaning & Validation
Removed duplicates and invalid records
Standardized data formats
Enforced schema consistency
Built Gold Layer – Business Aggregates
Created analytical aggregates for downstream use

## 📅 Day 8 – Data Governance & Catalog Management (Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge)

### 🔍 What I Learned

* **Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy** and how Databricks logically organizes data assets
* Basics of **data governance** and why access control is critical in analytics platforms
* Conceptual understanding of **GRANT / REVOKE** permissions
* Difference between **managed tables** and **external tables**
* How **views** can be used to expose controlled, business-ready data
* Importance of **data lineage** in understanding data flow across layers

---

### 🛠️ What I Implemented

#### 1️⃣ Catalog & Schema Structure

In Databricks Community Edition, I used the default catalog (`workspace`) and created a dedicated schema for the project:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workspace.ecommerce;
```

This schema represents a logical boundary for all e-commerce analytics tables.

---

#### 2️⃣ Registering Delta Tables

I registered **managed Delta tables** created from the Medallion Architecture:

* `bronze_events` – raw ingested data
* `silver_events` – cleaned and deduplicated data
* `gold_product_metrics` – aggregated business metrics

These tables are managed by Databricks, with storage and metadata handled automatically.

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN workspace.ecommerce;
```

---

#### 3️⃣ Access Control (Conceptual)

While Databricks Community Edition does not support `GRANT` / `REVOKE`, I designed access logically:

* **Data Engineers** → Bronze & Silver tables
* **Analysts / Business Users** → Gold tables or curated views only

This mirrors real-world governance practices used with Unity Catalog in production environments.

---

#### 4️⃣ Controlled Access Using Views

To expose only analytics-ready data, I created a curated **Gold-layer view**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW workspace.ecommerce.top_products AS
SELECT
  product_id,
  total_purchases,
  total_revenue
FROM workspace.ecommerce.gold_product_metrics
WHERE total_purchases > 10
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

This ensures:

* No access to raw or sensitive data
* Consistent business logic
* Simplified querying for analysts

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Governance is as important as data processing in production systems
* Views are a powerful way to enforce **controlled access**
* Managed tables simplify storage and lifecycle management
* Unity Catalog concepts can be **understood and applied logically** even in Community Edition

---

### ✅ Outcome

* Implemented catalog & schema structure
* Registered Delta tables
* Designed access control strategy
* Created governed views for analytics

📌 **Day 8 complete — ready for production-grade data governance concepts.**
